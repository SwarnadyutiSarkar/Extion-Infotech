Mitigation Plan
1. Outdated CMS Version
Step-by-Step Remediation:
Backup the current website, including all files and the database.
Download the latest version of the CMS from the official website.
Follow the official upgrade documentation to update the CMS to the latest version.
Test the website post-upgrade to ensure all functionalities work as expected.
Estimated Timeline: 1-2 days (including testing).
Required Resources: Backup tools, access to the CMS admin panel, developer expertise for testing.
Network Configuration Changes: Ensure proper file permissions are set after the update.
2. SQL Injection Vulnerability
Step-by-Step Remediation:
Review the website’s code, especially where user input is handled (e.g., search functionality).
Implement parameterized queries or prepared statements to sanitize inputs.
Test the input fields to ensure they are no longer susceptible to SQL injection.
Deploy the updated code to the production environment.
Estimated Timeline: 2-3 days (depending on the complexity of the website).
Required Resources: Access to the website’s source code, developer expertise.
Network Configuration Changes: No major changes required, but ensure the web server is configured to serve the updated code.
3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Step-by-Step Remediation:
Identify all input fields that allow user input.
Implement input validation and output encoding to prevent malicious scripts from being executed.
Test the website by trying to inject various scripts to ensure XSS vulnerabilities are mitigated.
Deploy the updated code to the production environment.
Estimated Timeline: 2-3 days.
Required Resources: Developer expertise, access to the source code.
Network Configuration Changes: No major changes required, but ensure web application firewalls (WAF) are correctly configured.
4. Weak Password Policy
Step-by-Step Remediation:
Implement a stronger password policy (e.g., minimum 12 characters, including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters).
Force a password reset for all administrative accounts.
Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for additional security.
Monitor for any brute-force attempts and adjust account lockout policies as necessary.
Estimated Timeline: 1 day for policy implementation; ongoing monitoring.
Required Resources: Admin access to user accounts, policy documentation, MFA tools.
Network Configuration Changes: Configure account lockout policies on the server.
5. Unencrypted Data Transmission
Step-by-Step Remediation:
Obtain an SSL/TLS certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).
Configure the web server to enforce HTTPS across the entire website.
Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS to ensure secure data transmission.
Test the website to confirm that all data is being transmitted securely.
Estimated Timeline: 1-2 days.
Required Resources: SSL/TLS certificate, access to the web server configuration files.
Network Configuration Changes: Update DNS records to support HTTPS; configure the web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx).
